For this interactive bivariate map, I decided to depict the parks in Wake County, NC according to zipcode. To do this, I collected my park point data and zip code polygon data from Wake County Open data. I then converted the points to a geojson using geojson.io. For the polygons with the zip code data, I opened the data in geojson.io and added the number of parks in the table for each polygon, then converted it to a geojson. I obtained my basemap from leaflet providers. Additionally, the major functions of this map includes the bind pop ups for each park and the point to layer function which sets the tree shaped point icons. I added a legend showing the number of parks per zipcode and what the tree icon stands for. I also added a title using commands I learned previously. I used Lora, Serif for the font of this map.
